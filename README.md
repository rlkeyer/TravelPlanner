# Travel Planner

My Code Louisville FSJS Project.  A travel journal concept with a feature to build and edit trip itinerary.  The Itinerary app can be viewed by scrolling down the page to the "Travel Planner" section or by clicking the "Travel Planner" link in the nav bar.

Instructions for setup:
1. Clone the Github Repository
2. Go to the root directory (travel-planner)
3. Run 'npm install' to install required packages
4. Run 'npm start' to begin the server process (Note: If this does not work you can run 'node src/server.js')
5. Open http://localhost:3040/ in your browser
